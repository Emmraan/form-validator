## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Validation System**: Unlimited fields, intelligent field type detection (e.g., email, password), and a custom rules engine.
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Email domain, password security, username analysis, disposable email detection.
- **Performance & Reliability**: Redis caching with automatic fallback, sub-100ms response times.
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript-first, flexible configuration, comprehensive testing.
- **Robust Security**: Integrated rate limiting and multi-layered DDoS mitigation.

## üîí API Authentication

All API endpoints, especially `/api/validate`, require authentication. This ensures the security and integrity of your validation processes. A valid API key must be provided in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "validationType": "dynamic",
    "formData": {
      "email": "test@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

For more details on API usage and authentication, refer to the [Dynamic Validation Guide](docs/DYNAMIC_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md).

## üö¶ Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and protect against abuse, the Form Validator microservice implements **IP-based rate limiting** for all `POST` endpoints.

- **Limit**: 100 requests per minute per IP address.
- **Mechanism**: Utilizes a Sliding Window Counter algorithm, backed by Redis for efficient and accurate tracking.
- **Response**: If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code and a meaningful error message, including a `Retry-After` header indicating when the client can safely retry.

**Example of a rate-limited response:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": ["TOO_MANY_REQUESTS"],
      "message": "You have exceeded the request limit of 100 requests per minute. Please try again after X seconds."
    }
  ]
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è DDoS Mitigation

The service employs a multi-layered approach to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ensuring high availability and resilience:

1.  **Edge-level Protection (Vercel)**:
    *   Leverages Vercel's inherent infrastructure, global CDN, and distributed architecture to absorb and filter common network and transport layer (Layer 3/4) DDoS attacks.
    *   Traffic distribution helps prevent single points of failure.

2.  **Application-level Rate Limiting**:
    *   The IP-based rate limiting described above directly counters application-layer (Layer 7) DDoS attacks like HTTP floods by restricting excessive requests from individual IPs.

3.  **Connection Management**:
    *   Express server is configured with `keepAliveTimeout` and `headersTimeout` to prevent Slowloris-type attacks, ensuring that malicious connections cannot indefinitely tie up server resources.

4.  **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization**:
    *   All incoming data is rigorously validated using Zod schemas and the dynamic schema builder, preventing malformed requests from exploiting vulnerabilities or consuming excessive processing power.

5.  **Resource Optimization**:
    *   The serverless function architecture and efficient use of Redis caching minimize resource consumption, making the service more resilient to traffic spikes.

6.  **Monitoring and Alerting**:
    *   Integration with Vercel's logging and analytics, combined with custom alerts for unusual traffic patterns or error rates, enables rapid detection and response to potential attack vectors.

These measures collectively provide a strong defense against various DDoS attack types, safeguarding the service's integrity and performance.
